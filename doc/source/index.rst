======================
 OpenStack Governance
======================

The OpenStack project is governed by two separate governance bodies,
formally defined in the `OpenStack Foundation bylaws`_. The bylaws define
a third body, the User Committee, which was previously run distinctly from
the Technical Committee, but those effectively
`merged <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/user-committee-charter.html>`_
into a single elected governance body in August, 2020.


Board of Directors
------------------

The `OpenStack Board of Directors <https://www.openstack.org/foundation/board-of-directors/>`_
has oversight over the OpenStack Foundation, and the assets the Foundation
protects (such as the OpenStack trademark). It is composed of appointed
representatives from Platinum sponsors, elected representatives from Gold
sponsors, and elected independent representatives. You can find more
information about the OpenStack Board of Directors activities and meetings on
`the Board wiki page <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation>`_.


Technical Committee
-------------------

The `OpenStack Technical Committee <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/>`_
is the governing body of the OpenStack open source project. It is directly
elected by all the contributors to the project, and has oversight on all
technical matters. This includes developers, operators and end users of
the software. Find more information about the
`Technical Committee <http://governance.openstack.org/tc/>`_, including its
charter, current membership, reference documents and past resolutions.


Project Teams
-------------

The `Project Teams <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/index.html>`_
are working groups that are directly responsible for the production of
OpenStack software releases, either through the development and maintenance
of specific components, or by running common development functions like QA or
Release Management. Find more information about `Project Teams <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/index.html>`_.


SIGs
----

The `SIGs (Special Interest Groups) <https://governance.openstack.org/sigs/>`_
are working groups that are not directly responsible for the production of
a specific piece of OpenStack software. SIGs activities center around a topic
or practice that spans all the community (developers, operators, end users...),
by forming a guild of people with a shared interest. Find more information
about `SIGs <https://governance.openstack.org/sigs/>`_.


Elections
---------

OpenStack governance bodies and leaders are regularly renewed using elections.
Find more information about community-organized Project Team leads and
Technical Committee `elections <https://governance.openstack.org/election/>`_.


Ideas
-----

The OpenStack Technical Committee is welcoming all news ideas of global changes
to OpenStack, within the `ideas repository <https://governance.openstack.org/ideas/>`_.
Changes related to a single official project should be discussed directly with
the project team instead.
