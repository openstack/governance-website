 OpenStack Governance
======================

The OpenStack project is governed by three separate governance bodies,
formally defined in the `OpenStack Foundation bylaws`_.


Board of Directors
------------------

The `OpenStack Board of Directors <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation>`_
has oversight over the OpenStack Foundation, and the assets the Foundation
protects (such as the OpenStack trademark). It is composed of appointed
representatives from Platinum sponsors, elected representatives from Gold
sponsors, and elected independent representatives. For more information about
the OpenStack Board of Directors, click
`here <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation>`_.


Technical Committee
-------------------

The `OpenStack Technical Committee <http://governance.openstack.org/tc/>`_ has
oversight over technical matters and the upstream open source project. Its
membership is directly elected by the contributors to the upstream project. For
more information about the Technical Committee, including its charter, current
membership, reference documents and past resolutions, click
`here <http://governance.openstack.org/tc/>`_.


User Committee
--------------

The `OpenStack User Committee <http://governance.openstack.org/uc/>`_
represents the downstream users of the OpenStack software. Its membership is
currently appointed by the three governing bodies, but should be directly
elected soon. For more information about the User Committee, click
`here <http://governance.openstack.org/uc/>`_.


SIGs
----

The `SIGs (Special Interest Groups) <http://governance.openstack.org/sigs/>`_
are a form of working group in OpenStack that is not directly tied to a
specific governance body. SIGs activities center around a topic or practice
that spans all the community (developers, operators, end users...), by
forming a guild of people with a shared interest. For more information about
SIGs, click `here <http://governance.openstack.org/sigs/>`_.


Elections
---------

OpenStack governance bodies and leaders are regularly renewed using elections.
You can find more information about community-organized PTL and Technical
Committee elections `here <http://governance.openstack.org/election/>`_.
