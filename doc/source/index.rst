 OpenStack Governance
======================

The OpenStack project is governed by three separate governance bodies,
formally defined in the `OpenStack Foundation bylaws`_.


Board of Directors
------------------

The `OpenStack Board of Directors <https://www.openstack.org/foundation/board-of-directors/>`_
has oversight over the OpenStack Foundation, and the assets the Foundation
protects (such as the OpenStack trademark). It is composed of appointed
representatives from Platinum sponsors, elected representatives from Gold
sponsors, and elected independent representatives. You can find more
information about the OpenStack Board of Directors activities and meetings on
`the Board wiki page <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation>`_.


Technical Committee
-------------------

The `OpenStack Technical Committee <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/>`_ has
oversight over technical matters in the OpenStack open source project. Its
membership is directly elected by the contributors to the upstream project. Find
more information about the `Technical Committee <http://governance.openstack.org/tc/>`_,
including its charter, current membership, reference documents and past resolutions.


User Committee
--------------

The `OpenStack User Committee <https://governance.openstack.org/uc/>`_
represents the downstream users of the OpenStack software. Its membership is
directly elected by users involved in the OpenStack community. Find more
information about the `User Committee <https://governance.openstack.org/uc/>`_.


SIGs
----

The `SIGs (Special Interest Groups) <https://governance.openstack.org/sigs/>`_
are a form of working group in OpenStack that is not directly tied to a
specific governance body. SIGs activities center around a topic or practice
that spans all the community (developers, operators, end users...), by
forming a guild of people with a shared interest. Find more information about
`SIGs <https://governance.openstack.org/sigs/>`_.


Elections
---------

OpenStack governance bodies and leaders are regularly renewed using elections.
Find more information about community-organized PTL and Technical
Committee `elections <https://governance.openstack.org/election/>`_.

Ideas
-----

The OpenStack Technical Committee is welcoming all news ideas of global changes
to OpenStack, within the `ideas repository <https://governance.openstack.org/ideas/>`_.
Changes related to a single official project should be discussed directly with
the project team instead.
